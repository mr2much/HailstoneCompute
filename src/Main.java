Hailstone Sequence

As a running example, we're going to explore the hailstone sequence, which is defined as follows.
Starting with a number n, the next number in the sequence is n/2 if n is even, or 3n+1 if n is odd.
The sequence ends when it reaches 1. Here are some examples:

        2, 1
        3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
        4, 2, 1
        2n, 2n-1 , ... , 4, 2, 1
        5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
        7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, ...? (where does this stop?)
